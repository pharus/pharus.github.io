================

The repository, on which I'll host my website, still just a skeleton of what is to be
Grateful to the Github community, for such offer

Sections I think I'll be having:
- Projects  : Projects I'll be working
- Academia  : My findings, and investigations, as well as my studies
	+ IST   : Specific to my university studies
- Opinions  : Kind of a blog style thing, things I want to share
- Writing   : Force myself to write something, poetry, short stories , whatever
- Objectives: My life's objectives in the moment and detailed analysis, with
  some data visualization, we'll see
- About     : A small bio 

Any opinions, just email me.
